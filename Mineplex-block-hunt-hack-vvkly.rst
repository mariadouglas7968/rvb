ChemistGMP and 7KTK7 caught using arrow hacks on a Mineplex minigame, Block Hunt.  · So I been playing Block Hunt and theres always a hacker on there and so what I did was download a block hunt minigame map on a custom server and played with my friend and of course I tested a hack to see if it really works and it does. Some hackers use a tracer hack or a better name tag hack. The tracer has the line to the player thats hiding and the name tag hack . Infestor Hider is the achievement kit in Block Hunt. It was added when a wave of achievement kits were added to the server in August Unlike Swapper, Instant and Shocking Hider kits, Infestors do not have the Change Form ability, they have the Infest one. It allows them to hide within an already existing block, provided that the latter one is something other hiders can .
