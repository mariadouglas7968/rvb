 · Block Specific IP Range. To block a specific IP range in order to deny, the incoming traffic coming from a specific range of IP. Execute given below command which drops incoming packet coming from IP till IP sudo iptables -A INPUT -m iprange --src-range -j DROP.  · I have to concur with everyone, Fail2Ban (which is a log parser that then applies dynamic IPTables rules against hosts). Used along with iptables-persistent or your own method of regularly saving IPTables rules and then loading them at startup, Fail2ban’s dynamic method to creating firewall rules on the fly is superior.  · IPtables is a user-space utility program that allows a system administrator to configure the tables provided by the Linux kernel firewall (implemented as different Netfilter modules) and the chains and rules it stores. Because iptables requires elevated privileges to operate, it must be executed by user root, otherwise it fails to function.
