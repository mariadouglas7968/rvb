Honorlock/Video Proctoring Hack/Cheat. Rant. This is an explanation as to why schools should not use Honorlock or video proctoring for attendance and classes. It's step by step to show how easy it is to "hack" Zoom and Honorlock, 2 of the biggest programs being used right now. Monitoring audio and noise: Honorlock can detect any noise that comes from or around the exam environment. If the content of the noise supports cheating behaviors, then the instructors will punish the student. This proctoring software has a voice detection feature that detects various forms of sounds. Serious Question: How many people are using Auto-Parry & Auto-Block actively in For Honor and not getting caught? Discussion I've played the most toxic rep 70 zerks/raiders/shamans and you name it's tonight, and this is with no salt, but actual, genuine curiosity that I write this.
