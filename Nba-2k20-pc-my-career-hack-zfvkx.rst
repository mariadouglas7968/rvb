MyCAREER. I own the game on Steam and am trying to figure out if it's ok to use trainers for "offline" modes like My Career. Simple stuff like infinite stamina, etc. I haven't played a 2K game in awhile and it looks like the distinction between online and single player is a lot different. The last thing I want to do is fire up the game one day. Dragonruler 2 years ago #1. I noticed MyCareer isn't there for PC or it's just me. Blah. GuitaristMatt 2 years ago #2. You have to be online. If you have a legitimate copy, make sure it's not a firewall issue/ restart the game. SteamDeck / GabeGear Ambassador. Ryzen x, RTX ti, 32GB DDR4.
